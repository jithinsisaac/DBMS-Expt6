### Laboratory Experiment No. 6
 
### Objective  
To create a HTML Web form frontend using Bootstrap, link it to the MariaDB database using PHP server side backend scripting language & performing CRUD applications on the form. To create a virtual instance on AWS EC2, install LAMP stack and to host the site & database on it.

### Tools used  
- Software: 
  - MariaDB
  - XAMPP
  - Heidi SQL
  - Git
  - VS Code
  - MobaXterm/Putty 
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap4
- Backend: PHP7, PHP-MySQLi extension
- Database: MariaDB 10.4.17
- Cloud: AWS EC2 running Ubuntu 20.04
 
### Experiment Outcome
- Create a Web form using HTML, CSS & BootStrap
- Link the form to a backend language (PHP)- 
- Use PHP with MariaDB for database connections using the PHP-MySQLi interface
- CRUD operations -> Insert, Select, Update, Delete  
- Make different webpages for CRUD operations  
- Note: Not using any Javascript & jQuery explicitly, except when used by Bootstrap.
- To create an Virtual instance on AWS EC2
- To install LAMP stack on the VM and host the site along with the database on it
